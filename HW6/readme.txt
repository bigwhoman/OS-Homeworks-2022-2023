compile main.cpp 
run with name of input as commandline argument
exp. main.cpp inp1.txt
now it will create a directory called outputs and put the output files in there.
note ** : inputs should be as **same** as the format of inp1.txt
note 2** : give input names with full file extension.

main.cpp inp1 	  --> wrong
main.cpp inp1.txt --> right
