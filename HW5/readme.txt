This program gets a number of pairs (m,n) and calculates the Ackerman function on the numbers.
**NOTE** : the rate of growth of the program is so big that when you calculate pairs with m >= 4, you will get segfault because of
recursive stack overflow (approximatly 19000 digits).
First enter number of pairs and enter the pairs and then the program gives each thread a task.
Build with build.sh
